RDraw is a web-based application that randomly pairs people online to facilitate a “whiteboard'' like communication. 
Users will be prompted to log in with their email/username and password. Our database will store the logins, high score tracker, 
and ratings. Once the user is logged in, they will be matched randomly with another user online at the same time. Another option 
the user has is to be matched with other users based on common interests. The two users will start to draw on a blank white screen 
with a variety of drawing utensils (i.e. pens, pencils, paints, etc). Once the users are done with their drawings, the drawings 
will be shared and rated by each other. The web application will store these ratings and give points to each user. The higher the
ratings, the more points the user will have, and if a user has a lot of points, they will be featured on the applications’ high 
scoreboard. Additionally, if the two users would like to communicate over chat, there will be an option to communicate on a chat bar. 
The overall goal of the web-based application is to connect random people to each other and bond them through the power of creativity. 
RDraw allows people to grow their artistic skills while socializing with like-minded people. As the next big social media platform, 
RDraw will maximize connections while giving users a reason to practice and hone their artistic abilities.
